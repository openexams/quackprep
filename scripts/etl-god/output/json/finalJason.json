The company charges their ad clients a rate per second watched. Therefore, it is of importance for YouCube to find out how long the users are willing to wait, in seconds, before the “Skip Ad” option appears on screen. To determine this information, the first 400 newly registered users were chosen. Then the company randomly assigned 4, 5, 6, or 7 seconds to wait for the “Skip Ad” option to appear on the screen for each user. Thus, each group has 100 participants. After one month, they will record the activity score of each user, ranging between 1 and 10, which reflects how active the user is on the platform at the moment of recording.\n\n(A) What are the units, treatment factor including the levels, and response variable in this study?\n\n",
